Learning Javascript for web development 

For the Otis project, due to the use of Firebase, knowledge of JavaScript became necessary
so that the front-end of the web part had an interaction with the chatbot developed in Python,
what happens and that the configured chat database in the firebase can only be accessed in HTML via JS.

Settings:

to create a javascript file it's enough that it has .JS at the end, but to use and observe the 
application it's necessary to have an HTML file linked to the javascript file and use a server

For the server you must know which one exists in your code editor, in my case (Visual Studio Code) 
I use Live Server, to download just go to the extensions and download

To use it in your HTML file, just click on it in the file explorer with the right mouse button 
]and select the option “Open With Live Server” and you're done.

PS: All the log commands appeared in the console of your page, which is available in the development tools
